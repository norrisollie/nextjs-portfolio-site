					<h2>A co-founder at one of the world&apos;s largest communities.</h2>

						<p>
							The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
							companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in
							not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
						</p>
						<p>
							I&apos;m proud to announce that I am now working at one of the
							world&apos;s largest communities teaching young minds about how to
							sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
							opportunities.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
							that&apos;s holding you back is yourself.
						</p>
						<p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
						<p>
							&quot;How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you
							wouldn&apos;t fail?&quot; You&apos;ve already gone through the
							hardest parts being a developer, it&apos;s time to elevate your
							skills and become a leader in something you&apos;re passionate
							about.
						</p>
						<p>
							I&apos;m happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help
							your company.
