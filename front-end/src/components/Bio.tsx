					<h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>

						<p>
							The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
							companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in
							not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
							largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell
							yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
							opportunities.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
							that's holding you back is yourself.
						</p>
						<p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
						<p>
							You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer,
							it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something
							you're passionate about.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
							company.
